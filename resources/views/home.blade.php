            2398 : 21 years after the Dominion War, 19 years since Shinzon and 11 years 
            since the destruction of of Romulus’ solar system. The galaxy is a different
            place and four uprated Ournal class Spacedocks are being constructed in 
            orbit around Earth – Spacedock Birmingham being one of them, and the first 
            to reach completion and commissioning.
            </p>

            <p>
            The new Ournals are able to house Odyssey & Sovereign class 
            starships as well as the Ambassador & Galaxy class vessels that the
            class was originally upgraded to deal with (Ournal Mark II such as 
            the Spacedock based Starbase 74). As part of the uprate to Ournal 
            Mark III they now have a second docking area above the main one for 
            smaller vessels around the size of Intrepid or Constellation 
            classes… and the up until recently top secret “Constitution X”, now
            designated as the James Watt sub-class.
            </p>

            <p>
            This new upper zone includes rapid swop out systems for the modular James 
            Watt sub-class along with precise rapid launch systems to respond to 
            mission specific requirements. The heavily shielded outer rim of the 
            “mushroom” contains a promenade and access to leisure facilities. 
            </p>  

            <p>
            Spacedock Birmingham will have a complement of eight James Watt 
            sub-class vessels, with four under construction in the adjacent 
            fleet yard dry docks.
            </p>

            <p>
            The project became the Constitution X when it was determined that the 
            outline, the very silhouette of an earlier refit Constitution class was 
            still regarded as not only a symbol of Starfleet but a symbol of hope due 
            to it’s association with the V’Ger incident, Khitomer Accords and various 
            other missions of the era as well as rescue and swift response missions 
            during the Dominion War.
            </p>

            <p>
            Once decided the spaceframe was targetted to be as similar as possible
            in external layout to such a famous design, while incorporating the 
            hyper-modular system designs and cutting edge technology from tomorrows 
            starships – capable of great humanitarian feats, but also a wolf in 
            sheep’s clothing, capable of complete modular swop out and launch in 
            under an hour from a correctly equipped Spacedock such as Spacedock 
            Birmingham.
            </p>

            Spacedock Birmingham is an uprated Ournal Spacedock (Mark III)  in 
            geosynchronous orbit above the city of Birmingham. Spacedock Birmingham 
            offers a meeting of minds and safe harbour for visiting personnel from 
            local ships and Starfleet as a whole.
            </p>

            <p>
            It is 20 years since Shinzon of Remus took control of the Romulan senate 
            and was promptly removed. Peace with the Romulan Empire was made by Captain 
            Riker of the U.S.S. Titan in the years that follows, but unfortunately a
            supernova in 2387 destroyed Romulus and in the following 12 years since 
            that disaster there have been major shift in the political landscape of 
            the galaxy. 
            </p>

            <p>
            The Romulan people have become part of the Federation along with
            Cardassia, and after more internal unrest, the Klingons have also 
            come in from the cold.
            </p>

            <p>
            As a result the Federation spans a great deal of both the Alpha and Beta 
            quadrants and Starfleet is a much more diverse organisation, four times 
            that of the size it was in 2364, in order to patrol the much larger 
            Federation, support it's citizens and still explore further.
            </p>

            <p>
            Starfleet is now an organisation made up of four command branches to 
            enable efficient chains of command and effective administration. Each of 
            these command branches has it's own symbol and Starfleet as a whole has 
            encouraged the return of both individual ship symbols and the return of 
            division symbols for command, science, medical, operations and 
            intelligence. 
            </p>

            <p>
                The Federation is big and powerful and misunderstood by many in the rest 
            of the galaxy who have, to their perception, seen the fall of the Klingon, 
            Romulan and Cardassian empires to this behemoth that even managed to 
            neutralise the Dominion. Border skirmishes with the Orions, the Breen 
            and the Gorn have become more frequent and every day brings new first 
            contact opportunities.
            </p>

            <p>
            Spacedock Birmingham is a Mark III Ournal class Spacedock. Though she can
            house ships as large as the Galaxy, Sovereign and even Odyssey classes 
            her dry dock facilities and those around her making up the Birmingham 
            fleet yards are building the latest regeneration of the Constitution 
            class starship that proved once again, during the Dominion War, that it 
            was an extremely capable and flexible spaceframe design
            </p>

            <p>
            Two generations on from the Wyvern subclass that the "Connies" took 
            on during the war, the new James Watt subclass (development code name 
            “Constitution X”) offers a well known space frame, a legendary silhouette, 
            known across the galaxy and a modular approach to make it the most flexible 
            series of ships in the fleet. 
            </p>  

            <p>
            An initial 8 vessels are being constructed for deployment as Spacedock 
            and Ambassadorial support, with further orders expected potentially to 
            support Earth's other 3 main Spacedocks and beyond.
            </p>

            <p>
            Spacedock Birmingham is a division command post hence the new symbol 
            which melds the original USS Enterprise and USS Defiant Constitution 
            class services patches. Spacedock Birmingham is the construction centre 
            for the new generation of those starships – balancing exploration and 
            defence capabilities. These vessels offer a more flexible mission 
            adaptable platform to the deep space exploration specific “city” ships 
            coming down the line. The move from the Galaxy class to the theoretical 
            “Universe” class vessels continues as starship development continues.
            </p>

            <p>
            With culturally diverse crews and an ever expanding frontier, new 
            challenges are always around the corner.
